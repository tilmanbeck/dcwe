# Dynamic Contextualized Word Embeddings

This repository contains the code to train **Dynamic Contextualized Word Embeddings** (DCWEs), proposed in the ACL paper [Dynamic Contextualized Word Embeddings](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.542.pdf).
DCWEs represent the meaning of words as a function of both linguistic and extralinguistic (social and temporal) context.
